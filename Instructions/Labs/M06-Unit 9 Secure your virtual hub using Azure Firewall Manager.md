# Module 06-Unit 9 Secure your virtual hub using Azure Firewall Manager

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you will create the spoke virtual network and create a secured virtual hub, then you will connect the hub and spoke virtual networks and route traffic to your hub. Next you will deploy the workload servers, then create a firewall policy and secure your hub, and finally you will test the firewall.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Secure%20your%20virtual%20hub%20using%20Azure%20Firewall%20Manager)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create two spoke virtual networks and subnets
+ Task 2: Create the secured virtual hub
+ Task 3: Connect the hub and spoke virtual networks
+ Task 4: Deploy the servers
+ Task 5: Create a firewall policy and secure your hub

1. On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual networks**, and then select **Virtual 
   networks** under services.

1. Select **+ Create**.

1. In **Resource group** select **fw-manager-rg-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** .

1. You should be blocked by the firewall.

    ![RDP session browser blocked on google.com](../media/google-home-page-fail.png)

1. So, you have verified that you can connect to the one allowed FQDN but are blocked from all others.

### Task 9: Test the network rule

In this task you will test the network rule to confirm that it works as expected.

1. While still logged in to the **Srv-workload-01** RDP session, from this **Srv-workload-01** remote session, from start menu search and open **Remote Desktop 
   Connection**.

1. On the **Computer** box, enter the **private IP address** of **Srv-workload-02** (e.g., **10.1.1.4**). Click **Connect**.
