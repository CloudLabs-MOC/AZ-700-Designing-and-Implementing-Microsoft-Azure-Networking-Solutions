# AZ-700: Designing and Implementing Microsoft Azure Networking Solutions Workshop

## Overall Estimated Duration: 40 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll create and manage virtual networks on Azure. You'll learn to design and implement networking solutions, including setting up virtual networks and configuring subnets. By the end of the lab, you'll have gained practical experience and the skills necessary to effectively manage and secure Azure networks.

## Objective
Understand how to create and manage virtual networks on Azure, configure subnets, and secure connections. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- *Designing and Implementing a Virtual Network in Azure* : Understand how to create and manage virtual networks and configure subnets.

## Pre-requisies

1. *Basic Networking Knowledge*: Understanding of fundamental networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnets, and routing.
2. *Azure Fundamentals*: Familiarity with the basics of Microsoft Azure, including creating and managing resources.
3. *Experience with Azure Portal*: Proficiency in navigating and using the Azure Portal to manage resources.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, you'll explore the deployment of three virtual networks across different regions to support various business functions. The **CoreServicesVnet** in the **East US** region hosts key resources like web services, databases, and shared services, with VPN connectivity to on-premises networks and ample address space for growth. The **ManufacturingVnet** in **West Europe** supports manufacturing operations with a large address space for numerous connected devices. The **ResearchVnet** in **Southeast Asia** caters to the research and development team with a stable set of resources and minimal growth needs. Each network is designed to meet specific organizational requirements, ensuring efficient and secure operations.

## Explanation of Components

1. *Virtual Network*: A logically isolated network in Azure where you can launch Azure resources. It provides the foundation for your network infrastructure in the cloud.
2. *Subnets*: Subdivisions within a VNet that allow you to segment your network for better organization and security. Each subnet can host different types of resources.
