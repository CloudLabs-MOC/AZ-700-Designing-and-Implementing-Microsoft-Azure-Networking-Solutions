6. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the virtual network and subnets needed for this exercise:

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "ContosoResourceGroup"
   #create resource group if it doesnt exist
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $RGName -Location "eastus"
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile azuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile azuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```

## Task 2: Create CoreServicesTestVM

1. On the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, select **Upload** and upload the following files **CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.json** and **CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory one by one from the source folder **C:\AllFiles\AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions-prod\Allfiles\Exercises\M02**.

1. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the VMs needed for this exercise:

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "ContosoResourceGroup"
   
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```
  
1. When the deployment is complete, go to the Azure portal home page, and then select **Virtual Machines**.

1. Verify that the virtual machine has been created.

## Task 3: Create ManufacturingTestVM

## Task 11: Test the connection between the VMs

1. On the **ManufacturingTestVM**, open PowerShell.

2. Use the following command to verify that there is now a connection to CoreServicesTestVM on CoreServicesVnet. Be sure to use the IPv4 address for CoreServicesTestVM.

   ```Powershell
   Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389
   ```

3. The test connection should succeed, and you will see a result similar to the following:
